                            One of Australia’s most remarkable natural gifts, the Great Barrier Reef is 
                            blessed with the breathtaking beauty of the world’s largest coral reef. 
                            The reef contains an abundance of marine life and comprises of over 3000 
                            individual reef systems and coral cays and literally hundreds of picturesque 
                            tropical islands with some of the worlds most beautiful sun-soaked, golden beaches.

                            Barracuda point is quite simply one of the top 5 dive sites of the world, 
                            making it the most popular dive spot in Sipadan. There is a huge shoal of 
                            thousands of barracudas often making a tornado and darkening the sun! 
                            A must do for any underwater photographer! You can also see bumphead parrotfish, 
                            dozens of turtles and reef sharks patrolling the area. Sometimes there is also 
                            hammerhead sharks, so keep looking to the blue! The site is composed by a 
                            steep wall going down to 22 m deep often with strong currents.

                            Very deep, wide, hole outlined by coral reef and inhabited by sharks. Is there 
                            another sight like it? 30 m visibility coming over the bathwater warm reef of 
                            vibrant colors, descending into a cool, deep blue hole where the water begins 
                            to waver and shimmer as you enter the transition from salt to fresh water at 
                            about 15 m. Watching the enormous tuna and other pelagics dive into the hole 
                            to clean themselves as you briefly remove your octopus to taste the fresh water. 
                            Then descending another 25 m to explore the stalagtites and stalagmites of ancient caverns.
